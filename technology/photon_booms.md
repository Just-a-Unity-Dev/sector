# Photon Booms

![photon booms](../images/thumbnail/photon_boom.png)

A **photon boom** (photonic boom) is a blinding light associated with shock waves created when an object (ship, bullet, etc) breaks the light barrier and excels the speed of light. Unlike the younger sister **sonic booms**, **photon booms** create blinding light that can burn through hardened steel, and other such materials.
