# Databank

![databank](../images/thumbnail/databanks.png)

Databanks are massive binary storage devices with a 'perma-lock' stuck onto it. Databanks on ships are usually built into an [AI Core](ai_cores) while the [Federation Great Network Of Knowledge](network_of_knowledge) usually consists of major databanks the size of entire buildings alongside entire libraries and more.

A 'perma-lock' allows full writing privileges to the disk until a physical switch is pulled preventing any writing.
