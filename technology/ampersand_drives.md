# Ampersand Drives

*Not to be confused with the space [Ampersand](ampersand_space) or the sector [Ampersand](../sectors/ampersand)*

Ampersand Drives (to be short) create wormholes in and out of Ampersand space, using a bottle of fine [Antimatter](antimatter) and regular Matter, the Ampersand drive mixes these two together and vents it out allowing to tear the fabric of reality and into Ampersand space.
