# Ampersand Drives

*Not to be confused with the space [Ampersand](ampersand_space) or the sector [Ampersand](../sectors/ampersand)*

Ampersand Drives (to be short) create wormholes in and out of Ampersand space, with a battery with the power of Sol's White Dwarf (formerly the Sun) allowing to tear the fabric of reality and into Ampersand space.
