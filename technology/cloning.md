# Cloning

**Cloning** is a technology created by the [Tauri Corporation](../factions/tauri) and the [Federation](../factions/federation) while working together. **Cloning** involves cloning a humanoid with a dead body or a brain.

**Cloning** recreates a humanoid as close as it can, it **cannot heal diseases, only injuries**. Brain damage, schizophrenia and more may persist through cloning.

A **Clone Pod** creates a fully organic body and brain with a dead body or a brain. Any injuries the previous body sustained will attempt to be healed by said **Clone Pod**.

If a brain is destroyed, punctured or harmed in any way, the cloning process may not even begin.
