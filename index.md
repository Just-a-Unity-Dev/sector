# Federation Grand Network Of Knowledge

> "Hello, I am your XPert, the FGNOK librarian. Though, you can call me PER. If you have any questions, you can search in my query console. Keep quiet in the FGNOK, please."

## Get Started

New to the universe? You can read the [Brief Explanation](brief_explanation) to read what's up, and if you wish to know it all, you can read the [FGNOK index](page_index)! If you wish to get inspiration on writing about a new faction, new technology or more then you can take a look at articles such as the [Tauri Corporation](factions/tauri), [Quadrantal Federation](factions/federation) and the [BEOWULF](factions/minor/beowulf).

## XPert

**XPert** is the AI that manages the FGNOK, though usually it doesn't make sense. You are able to help out **XPert** by [contributing here](https://github.com/Just-a-Unity-Dev/sector)! New contributions are always welcome.

## Things to keep in mind

- FTL is **not possible**.
- People travel using an [Ampersand Drive](technology/ampersand_drives), which basically opens a wormhole into Ampersand space allowing for easy traversal through Sectors.
- Each Quadrant (galaxy) has a unique trait about it, the Milky Way's being [Ampersand Space](technology/ampersand_space).
- Each faction is wrong in their own way, but it's up to the reader to believe which faction is morally good or bad.
- Culture is diverse on the Quadrant, one sector could be techtianity believers while the next could be athiests.
- Anything can happen on the Quadrant as long as it follows the laws of physics.
