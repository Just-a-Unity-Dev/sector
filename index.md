## Things to keep in mind

- FTL is possible if not in a vacuum, FTL is mostly used as weaponry (see: [photonic booms](technology/photon_booms.md)) on planetary combat.
- People travel using an [Ampersand Drive](technology/ampersand_drives.md), which basically opens a wormhole into Ampersand space allowing for easy traversal through Sectors.
