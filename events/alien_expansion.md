# Alien Expansion

The **Alien Expansion** took place in 2425 and is used to refer to a controversial era where humans discovered multiple [intelligence species](../page_index.md#species) and unfortunately did not know what to do with them. The **Alien Expansion** is also one of the leading causes of the [Human Union](human_union_split) and the [Federation Civil War](federation_civil_war).
