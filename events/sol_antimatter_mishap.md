# Sol Antimatter Mishap

The **Sol Antimatter Mishap** is used to refer the event in which an unknown amount of improperly secured hydrogen and nitrogen liquid antimatter transported by the [Tauri Division](../factions/tauri) to one of the Federation's orbital stations had it's cargo leaked and eventually lead to the declarance of uninhabitance of Sol.

The transport ship had to cross Sol, and took a wrong turn and is now orbiting Earth. The [Human Union](../factions/human_union) sent an attack vessel to secure said Antimatter after being informed by [Federation spies](../factions/federation), the [Tauri Corporation](../factions/tauri) has still not released a precise number on how much Antimatter the ship was transporting, however based on the research over 2 centuries; we can deduct that there was rougly around 80 tonnes of antimatter Nitrogen and Hydrogen liquid particles (-H,-N).

During the attack, the attack vessel destroyed the roof of the ship before the engines, causing a flameout in the transport ship. The transport ship shot an SOS signal but was redundant, as the attack vessel accidentally allowed said cargo to burn up in the atmosphere. Millions of civilians saw multiple odd glass tubes with odd liquid in them flying toward their cities only to explode 18 seconds later.

Earth was essentially sent back to the stone age.
