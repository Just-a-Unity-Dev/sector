# A Brief Summary

The current cosmic cycle is 84CC. Unfortunately, Cosmic Cycles take 250 million earth years to finish, so that is not a very good way of measuring time.

Most people use Federation Standardized Time (FST), which is also how Earthlings managed their time. 365 days, 7 days a week, 24 hours a day, 60 minutes an hour, 60 seconds a minute, you get the point. If and when you hear someone say **year**, they are usually talking about FST.

The merging of the Andromeda galaxy and the Milky Way galaxy has officially finished to form the Milkdromeda galaxy. The galaxy is currently trying to figure out how to keep itself from eradicating itself, the Federation continues to form peace and fail at it, while it also deals with a civil war.

The technological combination of multiple and species, inactive and active, skirmishes and battles forcing rapid technological growth in order to fight the enemy and win have lead to the 84th Cosmic Cycle.

Sol is dead, it has been long gone since 59CC.
