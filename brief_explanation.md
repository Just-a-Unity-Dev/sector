# A Brief Summary

In Sol years, the year is 4853, humans are around the same as humans in the 21st century, speaking Federation English.

The Milky Way galaxy is commonly known as **The Quadrant**. The quadrant is currently trying to figure out how to keep itself from eradicating itself, the Federation continues to form peace and fail at it, while it also deals with a civil war.

**The Quadrant** consists of multiple **sectors** which are agreed upon by the whole Quadrant.

The technological combination of multiple and species, inactive and active, skirmishes and battles forcing rapid technological growth in order to fight the enemy and win have lead to the 4853.

The Sol System is declared uninhabitable by the [Federation](factions/federation) after the Earth was deemed uninhabitable due to an [antimatter transport mishap](events/sol_antimatter_misha)

## Summarization Of Events

In 2098, Humans finally got off and began orbital stations around Earth. There were numerous arguments about this by the UN but ultimately, an ISS 2.0 was planned alongside civilian housing facilities. Meanwhile, numerous companies began commercial and industrial spaceflights.

Progress was slow between 2098-2124 due to Earth politics slowing down, however in 2132 one of the communication satelite officers ordered the shutdown of Earth-Space communication satelites, specifically the command satelites. For 3 days, Earth Commanders were unable to communicate to those in space. On the 4th day, the officer told Earth Commanders formally to stop land conflicts from affecting space.

This appeared to be one of the earliest forms of the Federation's existence, as just 21 years later, in 2153 the [Federation](factions/federation) was formed at a rally on an orbital station.

The Federation's goal at the time was simple, make sure land politics stop affecting space politics. Satelites from Earth to space were shut down, with Earth sending marines to the stations to shut it down.

Due to all the weapons that the marines used were being manufactured by the Federation, and that the marines had little to no time to train on how to use the weapons; the workers won against the marines and won their independence.

Following the creation of the [Federation](factions/federation), multiple divisions of the Federation were created, such as the [Tauri Division](factions/tauri) managing most research, innovation and manufacturing.

Around the time of 2205, the [Federation](factions/federation) began to suspect traitorous activities amongst the [Tauri Division](factions/tauri) workers, and told Tauri mercenaries to take out the main orbital station and wipe the databanks. Around three days later after the order was sent, the [Tauri Division](factions/tauri) threatened to use a planetkiller on the main Federation base, before seceding 2 weeks later.

The [Tauri Division](factions/tauri) (now the Tauri Corporation) was kind enough to license [Ampersand Drives](technology/ampersand_drives) to the [Federation](factions/federation) before seceding.

With the Federation's leading research department seceding, the Federation had to make due with the ships they currently had and created four main divisions: The **Administration**, **Engineering**, **Research** and **Defense** divisions.

In 2425, the [**Genetic Expansion**](events/genetic_expansion) occurred when a [genetic modification experiment](technology/genetic_modification), people were not sure what to do with said alien species. Some people suggested capturing them for research, others suggested incorporating them under the [Federation](factions/federation).

It took around 4 years for the [Federation](factions/federation) to come to a consensus, and within those 4 years; rumors of a major civil war occuring were widespread as a certain [Human Union](faction/human_union) were planning to secede. The [Federation](factions/federation) decided to embrace their alien brothers & sisters (and all other wacky genders they have) and welcome them all a seat on the [Federation](factions/federation) council.

Despite their previous hardships, the [Tauri Corporation](factions/tauri) offered an alliance and contract with the [Federation](factions/federation), in which they accepted.

The [Human Union](faction/human_union) immediately began to secede after hearing of this news, in an incident known as the [Human Union Secede](events/human_union_secede).

With the [Human Union](faction/human_union) seceded, it stole technology from the [Federation](factions/federation) as well. The [Human Union](faction/human_union) now had a fleet, and alongside that had contracts with the [Tauri Corporation](factions/tauri).

Today, the [Federation](factions/federation) fights a civil war with the [Human Union](faction/human_union) while the [Tauri Corporation](factions/tauri) rolls in money. Now, you're caught up.
