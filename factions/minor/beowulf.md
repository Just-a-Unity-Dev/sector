![beowulf flag](../../images/flags/beowulf.png)

>"As old Sol once said: Humanity cannot live without cooperation and intelligence, One for All and All for One. To peace and fairness."

Developing on research, study, discovery, technology, biology, development, renovation and recreation.
These are who will make a new safe earth, where humanity will be back again in past days where technology wasn't everything and where pollution didn't often spread around the place. And also find new planets, to discover. To learn. To better. 

It is independant and one of the first few leads of recreation and science, similar to Tauri but they do not profit off of combat and war, they combat off of civilian jobs and peace, welfare and fairness. They are the first intelligence unit and holds prized information. 

## History

Intitially founded in 4851, around December 12. The day a ship was detected exiting Deadzone space. This attracted the media, and caused a new research opportunity for multiple companies after proving the Deadzone was in fact able to be traversed, and giving some hope for those trapped inside.

The IIBE(UO)R (IBER) (Independent Intelligence Bureau of Ethnic Unorthodox Research) or the Beowulf is an independent multibillionaire faction that specializes on research and unorthodox discovery work, scout expeditions and have stations in Deadzone all over and out, noted the founder has been able to enter the Deadzone and out using a new space drive during the historical events of their journey, establishing a new faction of a new horizon that helped flock researchers for their skill and integrity, similar to NASA, except they explore near the depths of the near-observable universe to collect more information for the world and their unsolved required information to expand.

They are led by The Head of Administration by rank and composed of 6 Divisions in total, excluding the Head of Administration. Coming from varied forms of names and color of form. To expand on the world and astronomy once again, to discover, to research and to increase defenses for all of mankind, they are mostly passive & friendly, or neutral. Excluding to pirates. (they do not like pirates)

They often open trade to others, as that is what they do. To improve on technology and current equipment; similar to Tauri, in exception they do not profit off of war and instead of fairness. Civilians are open to trade with Beowulf and be unharmed, Beowulf currently is a minor faction, they profit engineers and researchers to their work alike. (They also profit farmers, selling seeds and often help regrowing a new earth)

## Issues

The Tauri Corporation do not like the Beowulf, for Beowulf profiting off of their own technology. After an Advanced Cloning Machine (the ACM) which were manufactured by Beowulf, which works only with DNA and required memory (main functions of the body), despite that even if the brain is punctured a human can be revived, but with small memory-loss. They offer it to Tauri for compensation and hopefully erase the debt they had from Tauri once they recieve it, to compensate for all deaths and that they profited off from their technology.

## Rumors
- The Blackbox recording which were inherently stolen by Tauri from Lucens Spei (the founder of Beowulf) which were classified Quadrant audio was leaked and Beowulf was blamed for it. It was not confirmed true yet but Beowulf simply claims that the rumors were false, that amused the public and simply stopped talking about it, except for some.
