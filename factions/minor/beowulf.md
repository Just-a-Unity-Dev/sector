The IIBE(UO)R (Independent Intelligence Bureau of Ethnic Unorthodox Research) or the BEOWULF (Beowulf) is an independent multibillionaire faction that specializes on research and unorthodox discovery work, scout expeditions and have stations in Deadzone all over and out, noted the founder has been able to enter the Deadzone and out using a new space drive during the historical events of their journey, establishing a new faction of a new horizon that helped flock researchers for their skill and integrity, similar to NASA, except they explore near the depths of the near-observable universe to collect more information for the world to expand.

## Divisions and Jobs

**Head of Administration**: Head Researchers that possess supreme command, morale and integrity over their job, hard working powerful individuals in BEOWULF with utmost responsibility that have gone through tests, those who do not have the wits and skill, hard work and loyalty do not get to this point of rank given the name, ALPHA.

**Defense/Arms Division**: They help manufacture weapons and increase defense lines in the field and the stations, having armory and firepower increased for self-defense, lowering the rates of death, renovating and fixing, things that stay in BEOWULF. For their hard work, they were called: SILVERWULF.

**Scout/Expedition Division**: Composed of Piloting Researchers and Explorers, normally those that take in trauma well and not often scarred, wanders deep into the Deadzone and marks territorial space, spacing the map more open, often reaching the barriers near-outside the observable universe and claiming stations nearby in solitude spaces, takes risks for BEOWULF, for their valor and bravery they were called the COPPERTOOTH.

**Supply/Cargo Division**: Often opens trades, have heavy ships and equipment, often transport goods and money but heavily armed to the teeth, Cargo stations are even more armed than Cargo Ships with no absolute mercy when it tracks you into radars, asking verification to enter whenever you get the slightest bit close by it's turrets, and will not shoot if you leave the area and do not get closer near the entrance without verification, they were often given the name RETRIEVER. As cargo strict tough cargo workers, albeit they allowed trade for profit they were incredibly restricted to trade for pirates, there are also many guards by the cargo room so stealing is near-impossible.

**Agent Research Division**: The second most basic and simplest Division, researchers that are trained for battle and ready anytime with first/medical aid practice, they often wear bulletproof protective suits, bulletproof vests and have phenomena technology they can utilize for weapons, often studying hostile or passive entities, different races, DNA testing and learning more about them and their places as they also sometimes scout, similar to biologists, but they also study about weapons and advanced weaponry to weaponize against hostiles and learning more about known yet unknown flaws and information of one thing that exists and another. Also supporting SILVERWULF engineers, often putting their lives on the line they were given the name MARKSTEEL.

**Standard Research Division**: The most standard division of all, even named CHARLIE, were basic researchers, contributing to unorthodox unknown research as to why this and why that, they give the answers to every question and they also are the ones to operate some major researches, such as cures to diseases, theories and of course to increase probabilities of success in a technology or something else.

**Clerk**: Self explanatory, welcomes researchers and has near all-access to all rooms and verifications, often acts as a guide and a welcoming mascot to BEOWULF. Has no title.
