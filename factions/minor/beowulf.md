They are led by The Head of Administration by rank and composed of 6 Divisions in total, excluding the Head of Administration. Coming from varied forms of names and color of form. To expand on the world and astronomy once again, to discover, to research and to increase defenses for all of mankind, they are mostly passive & friendly, or neutral. Excluding to pirates.

They often open trade to others, as that is what they do. To improve on technology and current equipment; similar to Tauri, in exception they do not profit off of war and instead of fairness.
