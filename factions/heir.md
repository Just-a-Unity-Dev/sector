# The Heir

> "The Federation is soon to die, and we are next in line."

A separtist faction of the Federation solely believing that the Federation is incompetent and requires a change in leadership, unlike the [Human Union](human_union.md) (which they are enemies with), the Heir does not believe in genocide of other species but rather Federation replacement.
